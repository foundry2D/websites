@Title {"About"}

Hi, I'm Ryan. I've been working with software and developing games since I was about six years old, when I was introduced to QBasic and RPG Maker. I've been doing game development ever since. I've always found myself fighting against pre-built engines and higher-level languages in order to get very specific results, so I became more interested in lower-level programming and custom game engine development over time. Nowadays, I spend most of my free time writing custom games, and game engines, with (almost) no dependencies in C.

I'm currently a student at the University of Colorado Boulder studying computer science. My professional experience thus far includes game engine and game technology internsips at Google, where I did graphics programming work for Stadia, and Insomniac Games, where I am doing rendering and infrastructure work for Stormland and other secret projects. Around a year ago, I became the team lead at Handmade Network to help promote more mindful software engineering culture.

This website is my a collection of information about my projects and random blog posts filled with software-engineering and game-development thoughts. I hope you enjoy!

*Also, here's a silly picture of me at an Easter family gathering until I get a more reasonable photo. On the two eggs I am holding up, I've drawn a simple geometric proof for the Pythagorean Theorem.*
