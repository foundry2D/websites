@Title {Telescope Engine}

The Telescope Engine began as a collection of modularized technologies that I originally developed for @Link {"The Melodist", "melodist.html"}. I began identifying that a lot of my work could be extracted into game-independent pieces that would serve as a base for my own game projects.

As of now, the engine is being used to develop two projects: @Link {"The Melodist", "melodist.html"} and a game called Arcane, being developed by Thomas Randall.

The engine is written from scratch in C. It features the following pieces so far: A 2D renderer, a 3D renderer with partially physically-based rendering (still early and experimental, it is mostly a side project I toy with when I am not working on my primary game projects), a multithreaded asset system that allows for arbitrary asset types, an immediate-mode graphical user interface system, a developer terminal, a custom scripting language, and custom platform layers.
