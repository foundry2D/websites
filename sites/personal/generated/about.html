<h1>About</h1>
<div class="image_container"><img class="image" src="data/me.jpg"></div>
<p>Hi! My name is Ryan. I grew up in Colorado in the United States. I found my love for interactive experiences when I started playing Super Mario 64 and The Legend of Zelda when I was about four years old. I've since developed a passion for making those experiences.</p><p>I've been working with software and developing games since I was about six years old, when I was introduced to QBasic and RPG Maker by my older brother. Over time, I found myself fighting against pre-built engines and higher-level languages in order to get very specific results, so I became more interested in lower-level programming and custom game engine development over time. Nowadays, I spend most of my free time writing custom games, and game engines, with (almost) no dependencies in C. You can learn more about what I'm working on <a class="link" href="projects.html">here</a>.</p><p>I'm currently a student at the University of Colorado Boulder studying computer science. My professional experience thus far includes game engine and game technology internsips at Google, where I did graphics programming work for Stadia, and Insomniac Games, where I did some runtime engine and tools work for Stormland and other projects. In mid-2018, I became the team lead at <a class="link" href="https://handmade.network">Handmade Network</a> to help promote more mindful software engineering culture.</p><p>This website is my a collection of information about my projects, and blog posts filled with software engineering and game development thoughts and experiences. I hope you enjoy!</p></div>
