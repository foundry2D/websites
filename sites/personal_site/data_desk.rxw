@Title {Data Desk}

Data Desk is a utility program that I originally wrote as a metaprogramming tool for @Link {"The Melodist", "melodist.html"}. Its purpose is to provide something that I think is missing from C and C++: Properly implemented compile-time type introspection and introspection-based code generation. I've used it for many different kinds of compile-time work in my projects, including entity boilerplate code generation, UI code generation to automatically implement UI that modifies structures, and vertex data generation for maps in @Link {"Dungeoneer", "dungeoneer.html"}.

The source code for Data Desk, documentation, and examples can all be @Link {"found online for free", "https://github.com/ryanfleury/data_desk"}. Additionally, here are some prebuilt binaries for a few common platforms: @Link {"Windows (x64)", "data/data_desk_win64.exe" }, @Link {"Windows (x86)", "data/data_desk_win32.exe" }
