@Title {Data Desk}

Data Desk is a utility program that I originally wrote as a metaprogramming tool for @Link {"The Melodist", "melodist.html"}. Its purpose is to provide something that I think is missing from C and C++: Properly implemented compile-time type introspection and introspection-based code generation. I've used it for many different kinds of compile-time code generation in my projects, including: Entity boilerplate code generation, UI code generation to automatically implement UI that modifies structures, vertex data generation for maps in @Link {"Dungeoneer", "dungeoneer.html"}, data serialization (and unserialization) code, and automatically supporting version-based changes in serialized data formats.

The source code for Data Desk, documentation, and examples can all be @Link {"found online for free", "https://github.com/ryanfleury/data_desk"}.
